* Have another route accept a single parameter (i.e. `"/<x>"`) and render a checkerboard with x many rows, with alternating colors
* Have another route accept 2 parameters (i.e. `"/<x>/<y>"`) and render a checkerboard with x rows and y columns, with alternating colors
* Have another route accept 4 parameters (i.e. `"/<x>/<y>/<color1>/<color2>"`) and render a checkerboard with x rows and y columns, with alternating colors, color1 and color2
